        "**Exercise 2:** Let's say you know that a given nerve terminal contains exactly 14 quanta available for release. You have read in the literature that the release probability of these quanta is low, say 0.1. To assess whether this value is reasonable, you run a simple experiment: activate the nerve and measure the number of quanta that are released. The result is 8 quanta. What is the probability that you would get this result (8 quanta) if the true probability of release really was 0.1? What about if the true release probability was much higher; say, 0.7? What about for each decile of release probability (0.1, 0.2, ... 1.0)? Which value of release probability did you determine to be the most probable, given your measurement?\n",

Because you are varying the parameters and not the data, the values of the function are not expected to sum to one (e.g., you can have numerous parameters that have a very high probability of producing the given data) and thus this function is not a probability distribution (see here for an extended discussion). The maximum value of this function is called the maximum likelihood."

        "**Exercise 3**: Not feeling convinced by your single experiment (good scientist!), you repeat it under identical conditions. This time you measure 5 quanta that were released. Your sample size has now doubled, to two measurements. You now want to take into account both measurements when you assess the likelihoods of different possible values of the underlying release probability. To do so, assume that the two measurements in this sample are independent of one another; that is, the value of each result had no bearing on the other. In this case, the total likelihood is simply the product of the likelihoods associated with each separate measurement. It is also typical to compute the logarithm of each likelihood and take their sum, which is often more convenient. What are the values of the total likelihood and total log-likelihood in this example, if we assume that the true release probability is 0.1?\n",

Therefore, compute the full likelihood and log-likelihood functions using deciles of release probability between 0 and 1. What is the maximum value? Can you improve your estimate by computing the functions at a higher resolution? How does the estimate improve as you increase the sample size?"

Now you want to test whether changing the temperature of the preparation affects the release probability. So you change the temperature, perform the experiment, and measure 7 quantal events for the same 14 available quanta. Compute p hat. Standard statistical inference now asks the question, what is the probability that you would have obtained that measurement given a Null Hypothesis of no effect? In this case, no effect corresponds to an unchanged value of the true release probability (i.e., its value remained at 0.3 even with the temperature change). What is the probability that you would have gotten that measurement if your Null Hypothesis were true? Can you conclude that temperature had an effect?"
